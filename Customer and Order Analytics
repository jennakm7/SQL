In this SQL, you can see that I queryed a database containing multiple tables in order to quantify statistics of the customer and order data:

#1 How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers cust
INNER JOIN FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price)
FROM JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT
sum(Quantity),
product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN customers cust
ON FEB.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';
